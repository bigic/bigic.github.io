    <p>If I asked you “<i>what sounds do birds make? </i>”, I bet the first sounds that come to mind are their beautiful songs. However, birds not only sing, but have a variety of different calls too.</p>

<p>Birds use calls to tell other birds about things that are happening around them. For example, calls can tell other birds that there is food or a predator nearby or keep them informed about where the caller is and where they are going.</p>

<p>Communicating about predators is very beneficial to survival. Not only does it warn kin about nearby danger and help keep them safe, but it can provoke nearby birds to harass or attack predators till they move on and become less of a threat. It may also tell the predator that its been spotted, so any ambush attempts would be pointless. The calls that birds use to warn other birds about predators are collectively called <strong>alarm calls</strong>.</p>

<p>Alarm calls come in a variety of types and different alarm calls can communicate different types of information. For example, particular calls can communicate the type of predator present, the level of danger it poses, whether it’s moving, and even its size. Intriguingly, some bird species only appear to have a single type of alarm call that they use towards all predators and threats (a general alarm call), whereas others species appear to lack alarm calls altogether. We don’t yet know why bird species differ in the types of alarm calls they use, but may have something to do with how closely they associate with kin.</p>

<p>Bird alarm calls can often be grouped into two broad categories. <strong>Aerial alarm calls</strong> are used towards aerial threats, such as predatory birds in flight. These calls provoke other birds to either scan the sky to locate the predator or to flee into bushes and trees to stay hidden. <strong>Mobbing alarm calls</strong> are used towards ground predators like snakes and foxes, but also perched predatory birds. These calls usually provoke other birds to seek out and inspect the location of danger, and if they see a predator, they may begin to harass or attack it.</p>

<p>Some bird species have very complex alarm communication systems, such as the Japanese great tit. Japanese great tits are small birds that build their nests in tree cavities or human-made nest boxes. Their nestlings are vulnerable to a range of different predators, including crows, snakes, and martens (weasel-like mammals). When there is a predator near their nest, great tit parents use different alarm calls, or adjust how frequently they call, depending on the type of predator present. For example, they give ‘chika’ calls if a crow is nearby and ‘jar’ calls if a snake is nearby. In turn, their nestlings respond differently when they hear particular calls, crouching when they hear ‘chika’ calls and jumping out of the nest when they hear ‘jar’ calls.</p>

<p>An interesting phenomenon is that birds not only understand and respond to alarm calls of their own species, but often recognize and respond to alarm calls of other species with which they share predators in common. This behaviour is a type of <strong>eavesdropping</strong> as other species are often not the intended audience of a caller’s alarms. Eavesdropping on other species’ alarm calls is widespread in nature and not just common to birds. For example, monkeys have been found to listen in on alarm calls of other monkey species and birds. Even a species of lizard has even been found to respond to alarm calls of a bird.</p>

<p>But how do birds recognize the alarm calls of other species? There are two prevailing ideas and both are supported by scientific evidence. The first idea is that <strong>different species’ alarm calls sound similar to each other</strong>, or share particular features such as being high pitched, and therefore can be easily recognized. Although there is evidence that this is the case in some circumstances, alarm calls of different species often sound quite different from one another, and birds may not respond to another species’ alarm call if they are unfamiliar with that species or its calls. The second idea is that <strong>birds learn to recognize alarm calls of other species</strong>.</p>

<p>My colleagues and I tested this second idea using small Australian birds called superb fairy-wrens as our test subjects. Fairy-wrens are small birds that usually feed on the ground and in the open. They are very good at recognizing and responding to familiar species’ alarm calls as well as unfamiliar species’ alarm calls if those said alarms sound similar to a fairy-wren alarm. We conducted an experiment to test if we could teach fairy-wrens to recognize “new” types of alarm calls. In our experiment, we designed and broadcast two “new” types of alarm calls to wild fairy-wrens. Each “new” alarm call was broadcast either in combination with a fake gliding sparrow-hawk or alone. Although fairy-wrens initially ignored both calls, after hearing either type of call broadcast in combination with our gliding hawk a few times, they began treating the call like an aerial alarm call. On the other hand, they ignored the call that was not broadcast together with a gliding hawk, showing they had learnt to recognize the “new” alarm call by associating it with the hawk.</p>

Why should we care about bird calls or eavesdropping?
</i></div>

<p>This can be a tough question to answer when asked by someone with no interest in the natural world, and is at heart of explaining why basic science and documenting natural history are important. On one hand, one can argue that it is fundamentally important to know everything we can about the world around us and the mysteries and complexities it holds. If you’ve ever watched a David Attenborough documentary, you probably understand that simply by observing and learning about nature, we come to appreciate it more. On another level, figuring out how and why animals communicate can help us understand how complex communication systems evolve, and in some way brings us closer to understanding why we as humans have evolved the most complex vocal communication system of all living animals. We also can never know whether basic scientific discoveries have potential future applications. For example, the knowledge we have gained from uncovering how birds recognize other species alarm calls can be used to help teach endangered and captive-bred species to recognize the alarm calls of other species at their release sites, thereby boosting their chances of survival in the wild.</p>
