<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>
The <strong>Tiny brown bird</strong> is a blog for all things bird-related. I write about interesting bird-facts from my own and other people's research to showcase all the wonderful things we are learning about the natural world.

</p>

<p>
Why the <strong>Tiny brown bird</strong>? In "birder talk", a <u>small brown bird</u> is the name given to birds that are considered common, dull, and uninteresting. But should one bother to look, one would often find that the dullest-looking birds are some of the most interesting and charismatic.

<p>
This blog is celebration of the wonder of birds, especially those "boring" common ones!

I'm an evolutionary ecologist by day and spend my nights drawing, playing boardgames, and learning new things.

<p>
I've been making this website from scratch, so it's a work in progress.

Please don't hesitate to email me if you have any questions about this blog or my research. If you would like to use any of the images, I can also put you in contact with their owners.
