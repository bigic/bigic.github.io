<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>
The <strong>Tiny brown bird</strong> is a blog for all things bird-related. I write about interesting bird-facts from my own and other people's research to showcase all the wonderful things we are learning about the natural world.

</p>

<p>
Why the <strong>Tiny brown bird</strong>? In "birder talk", a <u>small brown bird</u> is the name given to birds that are considered common, dull, and uninteresting. But should one bother to look, one would often find that the dullest-looking birds are some of the most interesting and charismatic.

<p>
This blog is celebration of the wonder of birds, especially those "boring" common ones!
