			If I asked you “<i>what sounds do birds make?</i>”, I bet the first thing that comes to mind are their beautiful songs. However, birds not only sing, but have a variety of different calls too.
		</p>

		<p>
			Birds use calls to tell other birds about things that are happening around them. For example, calls can tell other birds that there is food or a predator nearby, or just keep them informed about where the caller is and where it is going.
		</p>

		<p>
			Communicating about predators can be very beneficial to survival. Not only does it warn relatives about nearby danger and help keep them safe, but it can also provoke nearby birds to harass or attack predators till move on, or tell predators that they have been spotted, so any hunting attempts would be pointless. The calls that birds use to warn others about predators are called <strong>alarm calls</strong>.
		</p>
	

		<p>
			Alarm calls come in a variety of types and different alarm calls can communicate different information. Alarm calls can communicate the type of predator present, the level of danger it poses, whether it’s moving, and even its size. However, some species only appear to have a single type of alarm call that they used towards all types of predator and dangers (general alarm calls), whereas others species appear to lack alarm calls altogether. We don’t yet know why species differ in the number of alarm calls they use.
		</p>

		<p>
			Bird alarm calls can often be grouped into two broad categories. <strong>Aerial alarm calls</strong> are used towards aerial threats, such as predatory birds in flight. These calls provoke birds to either scan the sky to locate the predator or to flee into bushes and trees to stay hidden. <strong>Mobbing alarm calls</strong> are used towards ground predators like snakes and foxes and perched predatory birds. These call usually provoke other birds seek out the location of danger and if they see a predator they may begin harassing  or attacking the predator.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Some birds have very complicated predator communication systems, such as the Japanese great tit. These great tits are very small birds that build their nest in tree cavities or nest boxes built by people. Their nestlings are vulnerable to a range of different predators, including crows, snakes, and marten (a weasel-like mammal). Great tits parents use specific alarm calls towards the different predators, which may either by using a completely different type of call or using a particular call more or less frequently. In turn, great tit nestlings respond differently when they hear different parental alarm calls, crouching when they hear crow alarms and jumping out of the nest when they hear snake alarms.

			An interesting phenomenon is that birds not only understand and respond to alarm calls of their own species, but often recognize the alarm calls of other local species. This behaviour  is referred to as <strong>eavesdropping</strong> and is widespread among animals in nature, not just common to birds. For example, monkeys listen in on an alarm calls of other monkeys or local birds. Even a species of lizard has even been found to respond to alarm calls of a local bird species. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But how do birds recognize the alarm calls of other species? There are two prevailing ideas that are both supported by scientific evidence. One idea is that <strong>different species' alarm calls sound similar to each other</strong>, or share particular features such as being high pitched, and therefore can be easily recognized as an alarm call. Although there is evidence of that this is the case in some circumstances, alarm calls of different species often sound different, and birds may not automatically respond to a foreign sounding alarm call if they are from an unfamiliar species. The second idea is that <strong>birds learn to recognize alarm calls of other species</strong>.
		</p>
	

		<p>
			My colleagues and I tested this second idea using small Australian birds called a superb fairy-wren as our subjects. We conducted an experiment on fairy-wrens in the wild where we designed and broadcast “novel” types of alarm calls either in combination with a gliding fake sparrow-hawk or alone. Although they ignored these novel alarm calls initially, after they experienced the calls in combination with a gliding sparrow-hawk a few times, they started treating these calls like an aerial alarm call. By contrast, the ignored novel alarm calls that were not associated with gliding sparrow-hawks.

			This is tough question to answer and is at heart of explaining why basic science is important. On one hand, one can argue that is fundamentally important to know about the word around us and unravel the mysteries and complexities it holds. If you’ve ever watched a David Attenborough documentary, you probably know that by learning about nature, we come to appreciate it more. On a more personal level, figuring out how and why animals communicate helps us understand how complex interactions and communication systems evolve, and in some way brings us closer to understanding why we humans have evolved complex vocal communication. Finally, we can never know whether basic scientific discoveries have potential future applications. For example, the knowledge we have gained from uncovering how birds recognize other species alarm calls could be used to teach endangered and captive bred species to recognize the alarm calls of species where they will ultimately be released, thereby boosting their chances of survival.
