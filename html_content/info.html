<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>
The <strong>Tiny brown bird</strong> is a blog for all things bird-related. I write about recent findings from my own and other people's research, showcasing all the wonderful things we are learning about the natural world.

</p>

<p>
Why the <strong>Tiny brown bird</strong>? Well, in "birder talk", a <u>small brown bird</u> is the name given to any bird that is considered common, uninteresting, and not particularly beautiful. But should one bother to look, one would often find that the dullest-looking birds are the most interesting and charismatic.

This blog is dedicated to showcasing the wonder of birds, including all those "boring" brown birds!

I'm an evolutionary ecologist that studies bird behaviour for a living. I'm particularly interested in how birds use sound and colour to communicate.
